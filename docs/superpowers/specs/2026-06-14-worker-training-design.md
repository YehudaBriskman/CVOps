# Design Spec — services/worker-training

**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Status:** Approved

---

## Overview

`services/worker-training` is a self-contained Python worker service that consumes jobs from the `training` Redis Stream, launches user-supplied Docker training containers, captures results, and writes a `model_version` record to PostgreSQL. It is the only service with Docker socket access.

## What Already Exists

| Component | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Worker infrastructure | `packages/worker-common` | ConsumerLoop, JobRunner, session factory, StorageBackend |
| Step contract | `services/api/src/cvops_api/engine/step.py` | `Step`, `StepContext`, `GateException` |
| ORM models | `services/api/src/cvops_api/db/models/` | `Run`, `ModelVersion`, `TrainingContainer`, `Blob` |
| Storage abstraction | `services/api/src/cvops_api/core/storage.py` | `S3Backend.save_bytes()`, `get_bytes()` |
| ICD reference | `docs/services/worker-training.md` | Full spec for this worker |
| Handoff guide | `docs/guides/implementing-worker-steps.md` | How to build a worker service on worker-common |

## step.train — Full Flow

**Inputs:** `{ export_blob_hash: "sha256:..." }`
**Returns:** `{ model_version_id: str }`

### Step-by-step

```
1. Load config from runs row:
     { training_container_id: uuid, hyperparams: {epochs, batch_size, seed, ...} }

2. Load TrainingContainer row from PG:
     { image: str, icd_config: {inputs, outputs, volume_mount, mlflow_tracking_uri} }

3. Download export dataset:
     bytes = await ctx.storage.get_bytes(export_blob_hash)
     extract tar.gz → /tmp/{run_id}/dataset/

4. Create output directory:
     mkdir /tmp/{run_id}/output/

5. Build Docker env dict from ICD inputs + hyperparams:
     e.g. DATASET_PATH=/tmp/{run_id}/dataset, EPOCHS=100, BATCH_SIZE=16, SEED=42

6. docker.containers.run(
       image=training_container.image,
       environment=env_dict,
       volumes={
           "/tmp/{run_id}/dataset": {"bind": icd_config.volume_mount, "mode": "ro"},
           "/tmp/{run_id}/output":  {"bind": "/output", "mode": "rw"},
       },
       detach=True,
       remove=True,
   )

7. Poll container.wait() — blocks until exit (docker-py handles timeout via DOCKER_TIMEOUT env var)

8a. Exit code 0 (success):
     - Read /tmp/{run_id}/output/metrics.json → parse JSON
     - Extract mlflow_run_id from metrics if present
     - Tar /tmp/{run_id}/output/weights/
     - weights_blob_hash = await ctx.storage.save_bytes(tar_bytes, "application/x-tar")
     - INSERT model_versions:
         { project_id, blob_hash: weights_blob_hash,
           trained_on_commit_id: resolved from run context,
           training_container_id, hyperparams, metrics,
           mlflow_run_id: metrics.get("mlflow_run_id") }
     - return { model_version_id: str(model_version.id) }

8b. Non-zero exit (failure):
     - Read last 500 chars of container logs
     - raise RuntimeError(logs) → runner marks run failed

9. Finally (always):
     - shutil.rmtree(/tmp/{run_id}/, ignore_errors=True)
```

---

## Concurrency Model

- `WORKER_CONCURRENCY = 1` — one job per worker process
- Scale by adding replicas in docker-compose, not by increasing concurrency
- `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in the runner handles multiple replicas safely

---

## MLflow Integration

User-owned. The training container reports to MLflow independently. CVOps only:
- Reads `mlflow_run_id` from `metrics.json` if present
- Stores it on `model_versions.mlflow_run_id`
- Dashboard shows "View in MLflow →" link for runs that have it

No MLflow SDK in this service. No metrics replication.

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Container non-zero exit | `run.status = failed`, `run.error = last 500 chars of logs` |
| Container timeout | Kill container, fail run with timeout message |
| Missing metrics.json | Fail run — container must write this file |
| Missing weights dir | Fail run — container must write weights |
| MinIO upload error | Exception propagates → runner marks failed |
| tmpdir cleanup failure | Log warning, do not fail the run |

No automatic retries. Retry is manual from the dashboard.
